Hearthstone Simulator is an application to simulate the Hearthstone virtual card game experience. Instead of playing cards, you will be managing three resources: gold, time and skill. Your goal is to reach the Legend rank in the Ranked Play, but be careful; At the start of each month, the ladder resets and the meta might change, just like in the real game!

How to Set up:
- Download the .zip -file.
- Open the "index.html" in your web browser.
- Enjoy! :)
